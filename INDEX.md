## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test Locally First**: Always test changes locally before deploying
2. **Commit Often**: Small, frequent commits are easier to debug
3. **Read Logs**: Logs are your best friend when troubleshooting
4. **Use Environment Variables**: Never hardcode URLs or secrets
5. **Monitor Free Tier**: Keep track of Render's 750 free hours/month
6. **Cache is Evil**: Clear cache when debugging (Ctrl+Shift+R)
7. **CORS is Picky**: Exact URL match required, no trailing slashes
8. **GitHub Secrets**: Remember to add secrets for environment variables
9. **Base Path Matters**: GitHub Pages needs the repo name in base path
10. **Backend Sleeps**: Free tier sleeps - first request is slow
